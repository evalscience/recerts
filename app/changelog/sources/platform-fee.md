A small platform fee of 0.1 CELO will now be charged when you buy, mint, or list an ecocert for sale. The fee is automatically calculated and shown during these transactions, so you'll always know the exact cost before proceeding. For example, if you're buying an ecocert listed at 1 CELO, your total cost will be 1.1 CELO.

The fee applies uniformly across all transactions - whether you're creating your first ecocert, listing one for sale, or purchasing from another user. Your wallet will show you the complete breakdown of the transaction, including both the main cost and the platform fee, before you confirm.
