You can now attach supplementary material to recerts and share your thoughts about them. Each recert can include additional materials (datasets, reports, links) to support its claims, backed by blockchain technology to ensure authenticity. This means you can make informed decisions about which scholarly initiatives to support, with verifiable context.
