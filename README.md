# Recerts.org: An impact mechanism design journal

The goal of this hypercerts platform is to enable continuous funding for all of our project partners. Funders will be able to fund any of our partner projects' impact work, and receive a fraction of that hypercert (proportional to the amount that they have funded) in return.

Visit the journal at [recerts.org](https://recerts.org).

Partner projects define their work scope, cost and timeline, and funders anywhere in the world can fund this project at any time.

This platform will have impact metric integrations from various sources, including but not limited to:

- The green globe to show geospatial and environmental metrics
- Metrics garden for impact reviews.
- Karma.gap for milestones
- The projects themselves for any additional data that they want to add.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Node.js: this project requires installation of Node.js 18.17 or later. [Next Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation)

Ethereum Sepolia: The Hypercert Marketplace is currently deployed on Sepolia Testnet. To interact with recerts, you'll need to connect to Sepolia Testnet and obtain SepoliaETH from a [testnet token faucet](https://faucetlink.to/sepolia).

### Network Configuration

| Parameter                     | Value                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Network Name                  | `Sepolia test network`          |
| RPC URL                       | `https://sepolia.infura.io`     |
| Chain ID                      | `11155111`                      |
| Currency Symbol               | `SepoliaETH`                    |
| Block Explorer URL (Optional) | `https://sepolia.etherscan.io/` |

### Run Locally

#### Clone the repository

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:GainForest/hypercerts-platform.git
```

#### Install dependencies

```bash
  cd app && bun install
```

#### Start the server

```bash
  bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/reports/page.tsx`.

- [Hypercerts Documentation](https://hypercerts.org/docs/) Hypercerts create this interoperability by serving as a single, open, shared, decentralized database for impact funding mechanisms. A single hypercert is a semi-fungible token that accounts for work that is supposed to be impactful and whose ownership is fractionizable and transferable (under specific conditions). Hypercerts do not impose any specific funding mechanisms but provide baseline invariant guarantees such that claims will not be forgotten as different mechanisms come into and out of fashion. This is also why hypercerts are especially useful for any retrospective funding mechanisms â€“ funding can be applied to claims of the past.
